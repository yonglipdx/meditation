### Book One

1.	From my grandfather Verus I learned good morals and the government of my temper.

2.	From the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly character. 

3.	From my mother, piety and beneficence, and abstinence, not only from evil deeds, 
    but even from evil thoughts; and further, simplicity in my way of living, far 
    removed from the habits of the rich.

4.  From my great-grandfather, not to have frequented public schools, and to have good
    teachers at home, and to know that on such things a man should spend liberally.

5.  From my tutor, to be neither of the green nor of the blue party at the games in 
    the Circus, not a partisan either of the Parmularius or the Scutarius at the 
    gladiators' fights; from him I learned to edure pain, and to want little, and to 			
    work with my own hands, and not to meddle with other people's affairs, and not to
    be ready to listen to slander.

6.  From Diognetus, not to get excited abou triffling things, and not to get credit 
    to what was said by miracle-workders and sorcerers about incantations and the 
    driving away of dammons and such things; and not to breed quails [ for fighting],
    nor to give myself up passionately to such things; and to allow people to have 
    their says; and to have become intimate with philosophy; and to have been a hearer, 
    first of Baccheius, then of Tandasis and Marcianus; and to have written essaies in
    my youth; and to have desired a plank bed and skin, and whatever else of the kind 
    belongs to the Grecian discipline.

7.  From Rusticus, I received the impression that my character required improvement
    and discipline; and from him I learned not to be led astray to sophistic emulation,
    nor to writing on speculative matters, nor to delivering little hortatory orations,
    nor to showing myself off as man who practices much displine, or does benevolent
    acts in order to make a display; and to abstain from rhetoric, and poetry, and fine
    writing; and not to walk about in the house in my outdoor dress, nor to do other
    things of this kind; and to write my letters with simplicity, like the letter which 
    Rusticus wrote from Sinuessa to my mother; and with respect to those who have 
    offended me by words, or done me wrong, to be easily disposed to be pacified and 
    and reconciled, as soon as they have shown a readiness to be reconciled; and to 
    read carefully, and not to be satisfied with a superficial understanding of a book; 
    nor hastily to give my assent to those who talk overmuch; and I am indebted to him 
    for being acquainted with the discourses of Epictetus, which he communicated to me 
    out of his own collection. 

8.  From Appollonius I learned freedom of will and underviating steadiness of purpose; 
    and to look to nothing else; not even for a moment, except to reason; and to be
    always the same, in sharp pains, on the occasion of the loss of a child, and in 
    long illness; and to see clearly in a living example that the same man can be both
    most resolute and yielding, and not peevish in giving his instruction; and to have 
    had before my eyes a man who clearly condidered his experience and his skill 
    in expounding philosophical principles and the samllest of his merits; and from him 
    I learned how to receive from friends what are esteemed favors, without being either
    humbled by them or letting them pass unnoticed. 

9.  From Sextus, a benevolent disposition, and the example of a family governed in a 
    fatherly manner, and the idea of living conformably to nature; and gravity without
    affectation, and to look carefully after the interestes of friends, and to tolerate
    ignorant persons, and those who form opinions without consideration: he had the 
    power of readily accomodating himself to all; so that intercourse with him was 
    more agreeable than any flattery; and at the same time he was most highly venerated 
    by those who associated with him; and he has the faculty both of the discuovering
    and ordering, in an intelligent and methodical way, the principles necessary for
    life; and he never showed anger or any other passion, but was entirely free from
    passion, and also most affectionate; and he could express approbation without 
    noisy display, and he possessed much knowledge without ostentation.

10. From Alexander the grammarian, to refrain from fault-finding, and not in a 
    reproachful way to chide those who uttered any barbarous or solecistic or 
    strange-sounding expression; but dexterously to introduce the very expression
    which ought to have been used, and in the way of answer or giving confirmation,
    or joining in an inquiry about the thing itself, not about the word, or by some 
    other fit suggestion. 
    
11. From Fronto I learned to observe what envy and duplicity and hypocrisy are in a 
    tyrant, and that generally those among us who are called Patricians are rather 
    deficient in parental affection. 

12. From Alexander the Platonic, not frequently nor without necessity to say to any 
    one, or to write in a letter, that i have no leisure; nor continually to excuse 
    the neglect of duties required by our relation to those with whom we live, by 
    alleging urgent occupations. 

13. From Catulus, not to be indifferent when a friend finds fault, even if he should
    find fault without reason, but to try to restore him to his usual disposition; 
    and to be ready to speak well of teachers, as it is reported of Domitius and 
    Athenodotus; and to love my children truly. 

14. From my brother Severus, to love my kin, and to love truth, and to love justice; 
    and through him I leared to know Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dion, Brutus; and 
    from hime I received the idea of a polity in which there is the same law for all,
    a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and 
    the idea of a kingly government which respects most of the freedom of the governed;
    I learned from him also + considtency and undeviating steadiness in my regard for
    philosophy; and a disposition to do good, and to give to others readily, and to 
    cherish good hopes; and to believe that I am loved by my friends; and in him I 
    observed no concealment of his opinions with respect to those whom he condemned, 
    and that his friends has no need to conjecture what he wished or did not wish, but 
    it was quite plain.

15. From Maximus I learned self-government, and not to be led aside by anything; and
    cheerfulness in all circumstances, as well as in illness; and a just admixture in
    the moral character of sweetness and dignity; and to do what was set before me 
    without complaining. I observed that everyone believed that he thought as he spoke,
    and that in all that he did he never had any bad intention; and he never showed 
    amazement and surprise, and was never in a hurry, and never put off doing a thing, 
    nor was perplexed nor dejected, nor did he ever laugh to disguise his vexation, nor, 
    on the other hand, was he ever passionate or suspicious. He was accustomed to do
    acts of beneficence, and was ready to forgive, and was free from all falsehood; and 
    he presented the appearance of a man who could not be diverted from right, rather than
    of a man who had been improved. I observed, too, that no man could ever think that he
    was despised by Maximus, or ever venture to think himself a better man. He had also
    the art of being humorous in an a agrreeble way. 

16. In my father I observed mildness of temper, and unchangeable resolution in the things 
    which he had determined after due deliberation; and no vain-glory in those things 
    which men call honors; and a love of labor and perseverance; and a readiness to listen 
    to those who had anything to propose for the common weal; and undeviating firmness in 
    giving to every man according to his deserts; and a knowledge derived from experience
    of the occasions for vigorous action and for remission. And I observed that he had 
    overcome all passion for boys; and he condidered himself no more than any other citizens; 
    and he released his friends from all obligation to sup with him or to attend him of 
    necessity when he went abroad, and those who had failed to accompany him, by reason of
    any urgent circumstances, always found him the same. I observed too his habit of 
    careful inquiry in all matters of deliberation, and his persistency, and that he 
    he never stopped his investigation through being satisfied with appearances which 
    first persent themselves; and that his disposition was to keep his friends, and not 
    to be soon tired of them, nor yet to be extravagant in his affection; and to be satisfied 
    on all occasions, and cheerful; and to foressee things a long way off, and to provide for
    the smallest without display; and to check immediately popular applause and all flattery; 
    and to to be ever watchful over the things which were necessary for the administration of
    the empire, and to be a good manager of the expenditure, and patiently to endure the blame
    which he got for such conduct; and he was neigher superstitious with respect to the gods, 
    nor did he court men by gifts or by trying to please them, or by flatterning the poulace; 
    but he showed sobriety in all things, and firmness, and never any mean thoughts or action, 
    nor love of novelty, And the things which conduce in any way to the commodity of life, and
    of which fortune gives and abundant supply, he used without arrogance and without excusing 
    himself; so that when he had them, he enjoyed them without affectation, and when he had 
    them not, he did not want them. No one could ever say of him that he was either a sophist 
    or a [home-bred] flippant or a pedant; but every one acknowledged him to be a man ripe,
    perfect, above flattery, able to manage his own and other men's affairs. Besides this,
    he honored those who were true philosophers, and he did not reproach those who pretended 
    to be philosophers, nor yet was he easily led by them. He was also easy in conversation, 
    and he made himself agreeable without any offensive affectation. He took a reasonable 
    care of his body's health, not as one who was greatly attached to life, nor out of regard
    to personal appearance, nor yet in a careless way, but so that through his won attention
    he very seldom stood in need of the physician's art or of medicine or external applications.
    He was most ready to give without envy to those who possessed and particular faculty, such
    as that of eloquence or knowledge of the law or of morals, or of anything else; and he gave
    them his help, that each might enjoy reputation according to he deserts; and he always acted 
    conformably to the institutions of his country, without showing any affectation of doing so.
    Further, he was not found of change nor unsteady, but he loved to stay in the same places, 
    and to employ himself about the same things; and after his paroxysms of headache came 
    immediately fresh and vigrous to his usual occupations. His screts were not many, but very 
    few and very rare, and these only about public matters; and he showed prudence and economy
    in the exhibition of the public spectacles are the construction of the public buildings,
    his donations to the people, and in such things, for he was a man who looked to what ought 
    to be done, not to the reutation which is got by a man's acts. He did not take the bath at 
    unseasonable hours; he was not fond of building houses, nor curious about what he ate, 
    nor about the texture and color of his clothes, nor about the beauty of his slaves. His 
    dress came from Lorium, his villa on the coast, and from Lanuvium generally. We know how 
    he behaved to the toll-collector at Thsculum who asked his pardon; and such was all his 
    behavior. There was in him nothing harsh, nor implacable, nor violent, nor, as one may say, 
    anything carried to the sweating point; but he examined all things serverally, as if he has
    abdundance of time, and without confusion, in an orderly way, vigoriously and consistently. 
    And that might be applied to him which is recorded of Socrates, that he was able both to 
    abstain from, and to enjoy, those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot 
    enjoy without excess. But to be strong enought both to bear the one and to be sober in the 
    other is the mark of a man who has a perfect and invincible soul, such as he showed in illness 
    of Maximus. 

17. To the gods I am indebted for having good grandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good 
    teachers, good associated, good kinsmen and friends, nearly enverthing good. Further, I
    owe it to the gods that I was not hurried into any offence against any of them, though I
    had a disposition wiich, if opportunity has offfereed, might have led me to do something 
    of this kind; but, through their favor, thre never was such a concurrence of circumstances as 
    put me to the trial. Further, I am thankful to the gods that I was not longer brought up with
    my grandfather's concubine, and that I perserved the flower of my youth, and that I did not 
    make proof of my virility before the proper season, but even deferred the time; that I was 
    subjected to a ruler and father who was able to take away all pride from me, and to bring me 
    to the knowledge that it is possible for a man to live int a palace without wanting either 
    guards or embroidered dresses, or touches and statues, and such-like show; but that it is in
    such a man's power to bring himself very near to the fashion of a private person, without 
    being for this reason either meaner in thought, or more remiss in action, with respect to 
    the things which must be done for the public interest in a manner that befits a ruler. I 
    thank the gods for giving me such a brother, who was able by his moral charcter to rouse me 
    to vigilance over myself, and who at the same time pleased me by his respect and affection;
    that my children have not been stupid nor deformed in body; that I did not make more 
    preficiency in rhetoric, poetry, and the other studies, in which I should perhaps have been 
    completely engaged, if I had seen that I was making progress in them; that I made haste to 
    place those who brought me up in the station of honor, which they seemed to desire, without
    putting them off with hope of my doing it some other time after, because they were then still
    young; the I new Apollonius, Rusticus, Maximus, that I received clear and frequent impressions 
    about living according to nature, and what kind of a life that is, so that, so far as
    depended on the gods, and their gifts, and hlep, and inspirations, nothing hindered me from 
    forthwith living according to nature, thought I still fall short of it throught my own fault, 
    and through my won fault, and through not observing the admonitions of the gods, and, I may
    almost say, their direct instructions; that my body has held out so long in such a kind of 
    life ; that I never touched either Bendicta or Thoedotus, and that, after having fallen into 
    matory passions, I was cured, and, though I was often out of humor with Rusticus, I never did 
    anything of which I had occasion to repent; that, though it was my mother's fate to die young, 
    she spent the last years of her life with me; that, whenever I wished to help any man in his 
    need, or on any other occasion, I was never told that I had not the means of doing it; and 
    that to myself the same necessity never happended, to received anything from another; that I 
    have such a wife, so obedient, and so affectionate, and so simple; that had abundance of 
    good masters for my children; and that remedies have been shown to me by dreams, both others, 
    and against bloodspitting and giddiness...; and that, when I had an inclination to philosophy, 
    i didn't not fall into the hands of any sophist, and that I did not waste my time on writers 
    [of histoories], or in the resolution of syllyogisms, or occupy myself bout the investigation 
    of apperaances in the heaverns; for all these things require the help of gods and foutune.

### Book Two

1.  Begin the moring by saying to yourself, I shall meet witht he busybody, the ungrateful, arrogant,
    deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what 
    is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad 
    that is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not [only] of the same 
    blood or seed, but that it participates in [the same] intelligence and [the same] portion of the 
    divinity, I can neigher be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can 
    I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him, for we are made for co-operation, like feet, like hands,
    like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth. To act aginst one another, then, is 
    contrary to nature; and it is acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away. 

    每天清晨对你自己说： 我将要遇到好管闲事的人， 忘恩负义的人， 狂妄无礼的人， 欺骗的人， 嫉妒的人， 孤傲的人。 他们
    所以如此, 乃是因为不能分辨善与恶。 但是我， 只因已了悟那美丽的“善“的性质， 那丑陋的”恶“的性质， 那和我很接近的行
    恶者本身的性质 -- 他不仅与我在血统上同一来源， 而且具有同样的理性与神圣的本质， 所以我既不会受他们任何一个的伤害（因为
    没人能把我拖累到堕落里去）， 亦不会对我的同胞发怒而恨他； 我们生来是为合作的， 如双足，两手， 上下眼皮， 上下排的
    牙齿。所以彼此冲突乃是违反自然的， 表示反感和厌恶便是冲突。

2.  Whatever this that I am, it is a little flesh and breath, and the ruling part. Throw away the books; 
    no longer distract themselves: it is not allowd; but as if thou wast now dying, despise the flesh; 
    it is blood and nones and a network, a contexture of nerves, veins, and arteries. See the breath 
    also, what kind of a thing it is; air, and not always the same, but every moment sent out and again
    sucked in. the thrid, then, is the ruling part; condider thus: Thou art and old man; no longer let 
    this be a slave, no longer be pulled by the strings like a puppet to unsocial movements, no longer
    be either dissatisfied with the present lot, or shrink from the future.

    我之所以为我， 不过是一堆肉， 一口气和一股控制一切的理性。 丢开你的书本！ 不要再被书本所困惑， 那是不可以的。 要像
    一个垂死的人一般， 轻视那肉体 -- 那不过是一汪子血， 几根骨头， 神经和血管组成的网架。 再看看那一口气， 究竟是什么
    东西 -- 空气而已， 还不是国定的一口气， 没分钟都要呼出去， 吸进来， 剩下的是理性； 要这样想， 你是个老年人了， 不
    要再做奴隶， 不要再做被各种私欲所牵挂的傀儡， 不要再令他怨恨现世的命运， 并且恐惧未来的命运。
 
3.  All that is from the gods is full of providence. That which is from fortune is not separated from the 
    nature of without an interweaving and involution with the things which are ordered by providence. From 
    thence all things flow; and there is besides necessity, and that which is for the advantage of the whole
    universe, of which thou art a part. But that is good for every part of nature which the nature of the
    whole brings, and what serves to maintain this nature. Not the universe is preserved, as by the changes 
    of the elements so by the changes of things compounded of the elements. Let these principles be enough
    for thee; let them always be fixed opinions. But cast away the thirst after books, that thou mayest not
    die murmuring, but cheerfully, truely, and from thy heart thankful to the gods. 

    神的安排都充满了神意， 就是命运的播弄也不是脱离自然的， 也不能脱离由神意支配着的安排与编插。 一切都由神意而来； 不过“必然性” 以及
    “整个宇宙的福利” （而你只是其中一小部分）， 也是有其作用的。 整个的自然之所产生的， 整个的自然之所进行维系的，对于自然之
    各个部分亦必有利。但是宇宙之保全则有赖于变化， 不仅是元素变化， 且扩及与由元素复合而成的事物之变化。这样的想法对你是很充分足够
    的了， 如果你引为原则来看待。 放弃对书本所报的渴望吧， 以便死时了无遗憾， 而能从容不迫从心底里感谢天神。

4.  Remember how long thou hast been putting off these things, and how often thou hast received and opportunity 
    from the gods, and yet doesn't use it. Thou must now at last perceive of what universe thou art a part, 
    and of what administrator of the universe thy existence is an efflux, and that a limit of time is fixed for
    thee, which if thou dost not use for clearning away the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go,
    and it will never return.
 
5.  Every moment think steadily as a Roman and man to do what thou hast in hand with perfect and simple dignity, 
    and feeling of affection, and freedom, and justice, and to give thyself relief from all other thoughts. And
    thou wilt give thyself relief if thou doest every act of thy lefe as it were the last, laying aside all
    carelessness an passionate aversion from the commmands of reason, and all hypocisy, and self-love, and 
    discontent with the portion which has been given to thee. Thou seest how few the things are, the which if a 
    man lays hold of, he is able to live a life which flows in quiet, and is like the existence of the gods; 
    for the gods on their part will require nothing more from him who observes these things. 

6.  Do wrong to yourself, my soul; but thou wilt no longer have the opportunity of honoring thyself. Every man's 
    life is ufficient. But thine is nearly finished, though thy soul reverences not itself, but places the felicity
    in the souls of others. 

7.  Do the things external which fall upon thee distract thee? Give thyself time learn something new and good, and
    cease to be whirled around. But then thou must also avoid being carried about the other way; for thouse too
    are triflers who have wearied themselves in life by their activity, and yet have no object to which to direct
    every movment, and, in a word, all their thoughts. 

8.  Through not observing what is in the mind of another a man has seldom been seen to be unhappy; but those who do 
    not observe the movements of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy. 



##  The Encheiridion

1.  Of things some are in our power, and others are not. In our power are opinion, movement toward a thing, desire, 
    aversion (turning from things); and in a word, whatever are our own acts: not in our power are the body, 
    property, reputation, offices (magisterial power), and in a word, whatever are not our own acts. And things are
    in our power are by nature free, not subject to restraint nor hindrance: but things are not in our power are 
    weak, slavish, subject to restraint, in the power of others. Remember then that if you think the things which are
    by nature slavish to be free, and the things which are in the power of others to be your own, you will be hindered, 
    you will lament,m you will be disturbed, you will blame both gods and men: but if you think that only which is your 
    own to be your own, and if you think that what is another's, as it really is, belongs to another, no man will ever
    compel you, no man will hinder you, you will never blame any man, you will accuse no man, you will do nothing 
    involuntarilly (against your will),  no man will harm you, you will have no enemy, for you will not suffer any harm.

    If then you desire (aim at) such great thing, remember that you must not (attempt to) lay hold of them with a small effort; 
    but you must leave alone some things entirely, and postpone others for the present. But if you wish for these things
    also (such great things), and power (office) and wealth, perhapes you will not gain even these very things (power and wealth)
    becuase you aim also at those former things (such great things): certainly you will fail in those things through
    which alone happiness and freedom are secured. Straightway then practice saying to every harsh apperance, you are an 
    appearance, and in no manner what you appear to be. Then examine it by the rules which you possess, and by this first
    and chiefly, whether it relates to the things which are in our power or to the things which are not in our power: and 
    if it relates to anything which is not in our power, be ready to say, that it does not concern you.
 
2.  Remember that desire contains in it the profession (hope) of obtainning that which you desire; and the prefession (hope) 
    in aversion (turning from a thing) is that you will not fall into that which you attempt to avoid: and he who fails in 
    his desire is unfortunate; and he who falls into that which, he would avoid, is unhappy: if then you attempt to avoid
    only the thing contrary to nature which are within your power, you will not be involved in any of the things which
    you would avoid. But if you attempt to avoid disease or death or peverty, you will be unhappy. Take away then aversion
    form all things which are not in our power, and transfer it to the things contrary to nature which are in our power. But
    destroy desire completely for the present. For if you desire anything which is not in our power, you must be unfortunate: 
    but of the things in our power, and which it would be good to desire, nothing yet is before you. But employ, only the 
    power of moving toward an object and retiring from it; and these powers indeed only slightly and with exceptions and with
    remission.
 
3.  In everthing which please the soul, or supplies a want, or is loved, remember to add this to the (description, notion); 
    what is the nature of each thing, beginning from the smallest? If you love an earthen vessel, say it is an earthen 
    vessel which you love; for when it has been broken, you will not be disturbed. If you are kissing your child or wife; 
    say that it is a human being whom you are kissing, for when the wife or child dies, you will not be disturbed.

4.  When you are going to take in hand any act, remind yourself what kind of an act it is. If you are going to bathe, place
    before youself what happend in the bathe, some splashing the water, others pushing against one another, other abusing
    one another, and some stealing: and thus with more safety you will undertake the matter, if you say to yourself, I now
    intend to bathe, and maintain my will in a manner conformable to nature. And so you will do in every act: for thus if 
    any hindrance to bathing shall happen, let this thought be ready; it was not this only that intended, but I intended 
    also to maintain my will in a way conformable to nature; but I shall not maintain it so, if I am vexed at what happens.
 
5.  Men are disturbed not by the things which happen, but by the opinions about the things: for example, death is nothing 
    terrible, for if it werre, it would have seemed so to Socrates; for the opinion about death, that it is terrible, is
    terrible thing. When then we are impeded or disturbed or grieved, let us never blame ohters, but ourselves, that is, 
    our opinions. It is the act of an ill-instructed man to blame others for his own bad condition; it is the act of one
    who has begun to be instructed, to lay the blame on himself; and of one whose instruction is completed, neither to 
    blame another, nor himself.
 
6.  Be not elated at any advantage (excellence), which belongs to another. If a horse when he is elated should say, 
    I am beautiful, one might endure it. But when you are elated, and say, I have a beautiful horse, you must know
    that you are elated at having a good horse. What then is your own? The use of appearances. Consequently when in
    the use of apperances you are conformable to nature, then be elated, for then you will be elated at somthing good
    which is your own.

7.  As on a voyage when the vessel has reached a port, if you go out to get water, it is an amusement by the way to 
    pick up a shell-fish or some bulb, but your thoughts ought to be directed to the ship, and you ought to be constantly
    watching if the captain should call, and then you must throw away all those things, that you may not be bound and 
    pitched into the ship like sheep: so in life also, if there be given to you instead of a little bulb and a shell a 
    wife and child, there will be nothing to prevent (you from taking them). But if the captain should call, run to the 
    ship, and leave all those things without regard to them. But if you are old, do not even go far from the ship, lest
    when you are called you make default.
 
8.  Seek not that the things which happen should happen as you wish; but wish the things which happen to be as they are;
    and you will have a tranquil flow of life.

9.  Disease is an impediment to the body, but not not to the will, unless the will itself chooses. Lameness is an impediment to
    the leg, but not to the will. And add this reflection on the occasion of everthing, that happens; for you will find 
    it an impediment to something else, but not to yourself. 

10. On the occasion of every accident (event) that befalls you, remember to turn to youself and inquire what power you have
    for turning it to use. If you see a fair man or a fair woman, you will find that the power to resist is temperance (continence). 
    if labor (pain) be presented to you, you will find that it is endurance. If it be abusive words, you will find it to be
    patience. And if you have been thus formed to the (proper) habit, the apperances will not carry you along with them.
 
11. Never say about anything, I have lost it, but say I have restored it. Is your child dead? It has been restored. Is your 
    wife dead? She has been restored. Has your estate beeen taken from you? Has not then this also been restored? But he who
    has taken it from me is a bad man. But what is it to you, by whose hands the giver demanded it back? So long as he may allow
    you, take care of it as a thing which belongs to another, as travelers do with their inn.
 
12. If you intend to improve, throw away such thoughts as these: if I neglect my affairs, I shall not have the means of living: 
    unless I chastise my slave, he will be bad. For it is better to die of hunger and so to be released from grief and fear than
    to live in abundance with perturbation; and it is better for your slave to be bad than for you to be unhappy. Begin then 
    from little things. Is the oil spilled? Is a little wine stolen? Say on the occasion, at such price is sold freedom from 
    perturbation; at such price is sold tranquility, but nothing is got for nothing. And when you call your slave, consider that 
    it is possible that he does not hear; and if he does hear, that he will do nothing which you wish. But matters are not so well
    with hime, but altogether well with you,, that it should be in his power for you to be not disturbed. 

13. If you would improve, submit to be considered without sense and foolish with respect to externals. Without sense and foolish with
    respect to externals. Wish to be considered to know nothing: and if you shall seem to some to be a person of importance, 
    distrust yourself. For you should know that it is not easy both to keep your will in a condition conformable to nature and (to secure) 
    external things: but if a man is careful about the one, it is an absolute necessity that he will neglect the other.

14. If you would have your childen and your wife and your firends to live forever you are silly; for you would have the things 
    which are not in your power to be in your power, and the things which belong to others to be yours. So if you would have your 
    slave to be free from faults, you are a fool; for you would have badness not to be badness, but something else. But if  you wish
    not to fail in your desires, you are able to do that. Practice then this which you are able to do. He is the master of every
    man who has the power over the things, which another person wishes or does not wish, the power to confer them on him or to 
    take them away. Whoever then wishes to be free, let him never wish for anything nor avoid anything which depends on others:
    if he does not observe this rule, he must be a slave.

15. Remember that in life you ought to behave as at a banquet. Suppose that something is carried round and is oppsite to you. 
    Strech out your hand and take a portion with decency: Suppose that it passes by you. Do not detain it. "Suppose that it is 
    not yet come to you. Do not send your desire forward to it, but wait until it is opposite to you. Do so with respect to
    children, so with respect to a wife, so with respect to magisterial offices, so with respect to wealth, and you will be 
    some time a worthy partner of the banquets of the gods. But if you take none of the things which are set before, and even
    despise them, then you will be not only a fellow-banqueter witht the gods, but also a parner with them in power. For by 
    acting thus Diogenes and Heracleitus and those like them were deservedly divine, and were so called. 

16. Whe you see a person weeping in sorrow either when a child goes abroad or when he is dead, or when the man has lost his
    property, take care that the apperance do not hurry you away with it, as if he were suffering in external things. But 
    straightway make a distinction in your own mind, and be in readiness to say, it is not that which has happended that afflicts 
    this man, for it does not afflict another, but it is the opinion about this thing wich afflects the man. So far as 
    words then do not be unwilling to show him sympathy, and even if it happens so, to lament with him. But take care that you 
    do not lament internally also. 

17. Remember that thou art an actor in a play of such a kind as the teacher (author) may choose; if short, of a short one; 
    if long, of a long one: if he wishes you to act the part of a poor man, see that you act the part naturally; if the part of
    of a lame man, of a magistrate, of a private person, (do the same). For this is your duty, to act well the part that is 
    given to you; but to select the part, belongs to others.

18. When a raven has croaked inauspiciously, let not the apperance hurry you away with it; but straightway make a distinction 
    in your main and say, None of the thse thing is signified to me, but either to my poor body, or to my small property, or 
    to my reputation, or to my children or to my wife: but to me all significations are auspicious if I choose. For whatever 
    of these things results, it is in my power to derive benefit from it.
 
19. You can be invincible, if you enter into no contest in which it is not in your power to conquer. Take care then when you
    observe a man honored before others or possessed of great power or highly esteemed for any reason, not to suppose him happy, 
    and be not carried away by the apperance. For if the nature of the good is in our power, neither envy nor jealousy will 
    have a place in us. But you yourself will not wish to be a general for senator or consul, but a free man: and there is 
    only one way to this, to despise (care not for ) the things which are not in our power.

20. Remember that it is not he reviles you or strikes you, who insult you, but it is your opinion about these things as being insulting.
    When then a man irritates you, you must know that it is your own opinion which has irritated you. Therefore especilly
    try not to be carried away by the apperance. For if you once gain time and delay, you will more easilly master yourself.

21. Let death and exile and every other thing which appears dreadful be daily before your eyes; but most of all death: and you
    will never think of anything means nor will you desire anything extravagantly.
 
22. If you desire philosophy, prepare yourself from the beginning to be rediculed, to expect that many will sneer at you, and say, 
    He has all at once returned to us as a philosopher; and whence does he get this supercilious look for us? Do you not show
    a supercilious look; but hold on to the things which seems to you best as one appointed by God to this station. And remember
    that if you abide in the same priciples, these men who first ridiculed will afterward admire you: but you shall have been 
    overpowered by them, you will bring on yourself double ridicule.

23. If it should ever happen to you to be turned to externals in order to please some person, you must know that you have lost your
    purpose in life. Be satisfied then in everthing with being a philosopher; and if you with to seem also to any person to 
    be a philosopher, appear so to yourself, and you will be able to do this.

24. Let not these thoughts afflicts you, I shall live unhonored and be nobody nowhere. For if want of honor (?) is an evil, you 
    cannot be in evil through the means (fault) of another any more than you can be involved in anything base. It is then your 
    bussiness to obtain the rank of a magistrate, or to be received at a banquet? By no means. How then can this be want of honor
    (dishonor)? And how will you be nobody nowwhere, when you ought to be somebody in those things only which are in your power, 
    in which indeed it is permitted to you to be a man of the greatest worth? But your friends will be without assistance! What 
    do you mean by being without assistance? They will not receive money from you, nor will you make them Roman Citizens. Who 
    then told you that these are among the things which are in our power, and not in the power of others? And who can give to
    another what he has not himself? Acquire money then, your friends say, that we also may have something. If I can acquire 
    money and slso keep myself modest, and faithful and magnamimous, point out the way, and I will acquire it. But if you ask
    me to lose the things which are good and my own, in order that you may gain the things which are not good, see how unfair
    silly you are. Besides, which would you rather have, money or a faithful and modest friend? For this end then rather help
    me to be such a man, and do not ask me to do this by which I shall lose that character. But my country, you say, as far as
    it depends on me, will be without my help. I ask again, what help do you mean? It will not have porticose or baths through you.
    And what does this mean? For it is not furnished with shoes by means of a smith, nor with arms by means of a shoemaker. But 
    it is enough if every man fully discharges the work that is his own: and if you provided it with another citizen faithful 
    and modest, would you not be useful to it? Yes, Then you also connot be useless to it. What place then, you say, shoull i hold
    in the city? Whatever you can, if you maintain at the same time your fidelityh and modesty, But if when you wish to be useful
    to the state, you shall lose these qualities, what profit could you be to it, if  you were made shameless and faithless? 

25. Has any man been prefered before you at a banquet, or in being saluted, or in being invited to a consultation? If these things 
    are good, yhou ought to rejoice that he has obtained them: but if bad, be not grieved because you have not obtainted them;
    and remember that you cannot, if you do not the same things in order to obtain what is not in our power, be considered worthy 
    of the same (equal) thing. For how can a man obtain an equal share with another when he does not visit man's doors as thnat other
    man does, when he does not attend him when he goes abroad, as the other man does; when he does not praise (flatter) him as
    another does; You will be unjust then and insatiable, if you do not part with the price, in return for which those things are 
    sold, and you wish to obtain them for nothing. Well, what is the price of lettuces? An obolus perhaps. If then a man gives up 
    the obolus, and receives the lettuces, and if you do not give up the obolus and do not obtain the lettuces, do not suppose that
    you receive less than he who has got the lettuces; for as he has the lettuces, so you have the obolus which you did not give. 
    In the same way then in the other matter also you have not been invited to a man's feast, for you did not give to the host 
    the prices at which the supper is sold; but he sells it for praise (flattery), he sells it for personal attention. Given then
    the price, if it is for your interest, for which it is sold. But if you wish both not to give the price and to obtain the things, 
    you are insatiable and silly. Have you nothing then in place of the supper? You have indeed, you have the not falttering of him, 
    whom you did not choose to flatter; you have the not enduring of the man when he enters the room.

26. We may learn the wish (will) of nature from the things in which we do not differ from one another. For instance, when someone
    else's slave-boy breaks a cup, we're ready at once to say, 'That's just one of those things'. So you should beclear, then, 
    that if your won cup gets broken, you ought to react in exactly the same way as when someone else's does. Transfer the principle 
    to greater matters too. Someone else's child or wife has died there isn't anyone who wouldn't say, 'Such is our human lot.' And
    yet when one's own child or wife dies, one cries out at once, 'Oh poor wretch that I am.' But we ought to remember how we feel 
    when we hear that the same thing has happened to others.
 
27. Just as a target isn't set up to be missed, so nothing that is bad by nature comes into being in the universe. 

28. If someone handed over your body to somebody whom you encountered, you'd be furious; but that you hand over your mind to anyone
    who comes along, so that, if he abused you, it becomes disturbed and confused, do you feel no shame at that? 

 
29.1. In each action that you undertake, consider what comes before and what follows after, and only then proceed to the action 
    itself. Otherwise you'll set about it with enthusiasm because you've never given any thought to the consequences that will 
    follow, and then you'll give up in an ignominious fashion when one or another of them makes its apperance. 

29.2. 'I want to win an Olympic victory' Well, condider what comes before and what follows after, and only then, if thre is any
    advantage for you in it, actually set to work.

29.3. You must accept that discipline, submit to a diet, abstain from eating cakes, train under orders, at a fixed time, in heat
    or cold, and you mustn't drink cold water or wine just as you wish; in short, you must give youself up to your trainer as 
    you would to a doctor,

29.4. and then, when the time comes for the context, you must set about digging, and sometimes dislocate your wrist, or sprain you
    ankle, and swallow quantities of sand, and get whipped-and then sometimes get defeated even after all of that!

29.5. When you've refleced about these things, go on then to become an athlete if you still want to; otherwise recognize that 
    you're behaving as children do, who play at being athletes at one moment, and then at being gladiators, and then blow a 
    trumpet, and then act out scenes that they have seen and admired.
 
29.6. For your own part likewise, you are sometimes an athlete, sometimes a gladiator, then a philosopher, then an orator, but
    nothing at all whole-heartedly; no, in the manner of an ape, you imitate everthing that you see, and one thing after another
    is always catching your fancy, but ceases to amuse you as soon as you grow accustomed to it.

29.7. For you've never embarked on anything after due consideration, nor after having subjected it to proper examination and tested
    it out, but always at random and in a half-hearted fashion.

29.8. So it comes about that some people, after seeing a philosopher and hearing someone talking like Euphrates - and yet who is
    capable of talking like him? - want to become philosophers in their turn.

29.9. Condider first of all, man, what it is that you're taking on, and then your own nature too and what you'reable to bear. If you
    wanted to be a wrestler, you'd have to look at your shoulders, your back, your thighs; 
 
29.10. for different people are made for different things. Do yo suppose that you can act as you do at present and yet be a 
    philosopher? Do you suppose that you can act as you do, drink as you do, lose your temper as you do, and be as irritable as you are? 

29.11. you must stay up at night, toil away, overcome certain desires, become sperated from those who are close to you, suffer scorn 
    from a little slave, be laughed at by those whom you meet, and come off worse in everthing, in power, in honour, in the courts.

29.12. When you've weighed up all of this, then approach philosophy if you think fit, if you're willing to give up all of this 
    in exchange for serenity, freedom, peace of mind. Otherwires, don't come near, don't act as children do and be a philosopher 
    at one time, and later a tax-collector, and then an orator, and then one of Caesar's procurators. 
29.13. These things don't go together. You must be just one main, either good or bad; you must devote your efforts either to your ruling
    centre or to external things; in otherwords, you must assume the part either of a philosopher or of a layman.
 
30. Appropriate actions are measured on the whole by our social relationships. He is your father: you're obliged to take care of
    him, to give way to him in everything, to put up with it if he scolds you or strikes you. 'But he's a bad father'. Do the ties
    of nature bind you, then, only to a good father? No, but to a father. 'My brother is wronging me.' Very well, maintain the
    relation that you have towards him; don't look to what he is doing, but to what you must do if you are to keep your choice in
    harmony with nature. For no one will cause you harm if you don't wish it; you'll have been harmed only when you supposed that
    you've been harmed. In this way, then, you'll discover the appropriate actions to expect from a neighbour, from a felow citizen, 
    from a general, if you get into the habit of examining your social relationships.
 
31.1 As regards peity towards the gods, you should know that the most important point is to hold correct opinions about them, regarding
    them as beings who exist and govern the universe well and justly, and to have made up your mind to obey them and submit to 
    everything that comes about, and to fall in with it of your own free will, as something that has been brought to pass by the highest
    intelligence. For if you follow that course, you'll never find fault with he gods or accuse them of having neglected you.
31.2  But it isn't possible for you to achieve this in any other way than by withdrawing your conception of good and bad from the things
    that are not within our power, and placing it in those things alone that are within our power. For if you regard any of the former 
    as being good or bad, it will necessarily follow that, whenever you fail to get what you want to fall into things that you want to 
    avoid, you'll blame and hate those who are responsible. 
31.3  For it lies in the nature of every living creature that it should flee from and seek to avoid those things that seem harmful to it, 
    and pursue and admire those that are helpful and all that gives rise to them. Accordingly, it is impossible for someone who thinks
    that he is suffering harm to take pleasure in what he thinks to be responsible for that harm, just as it is impossible for him to take 
    pleasure in the harm itself. 
31.4  And so it comes about that even a father is abused by his son if he fails to give him a share of the things that pass for good; and
    it was this that caused Etocles and Polycices to become enemies: the idea that the throne was a good thing. That is why a farmer 
    reviles the gods, and so too a sailor or merchant, and those who have lost their wives and children. For where a person's interest
    lies, there too lies his peity. It follows that whoever takes care to exercise his desires and aversions as he ought is taking care
    at the same time that he'll act with piety. 
31.5  But it is also appropriate on each occasion to offer libations and sacrifices, and first fruits, in accordance with the customs of
    our forebears, and do so with purity, and in no casual or perfunctory manner, and neither stingily nor beyond what we can affort.

32.1  When you take resouse to divination, remember that you don't know how that matter in question will turn out, but that you've come to
    discover that from the diviner; but if you are indeed a philosopher, you already know when you arrive what kind of thing it is. 
    For it it is one of those things that are not within our power, it follows with absolute certainty that it must be neigher good nor bad.
32.2  So you should bring neither desire nor aversion to the diviner, and you shouldn't approach him with trepidation, But as  one who
    fully recognized that every outcomes is indifferent and of no concern to you, and that whatever it may be, it will be possible for
    you to make good use of it, and that no one can prevent you from doing so. So approach the gods with condifence, as your advisers, 
    and afterwards, when some advice has been granted to you, remember who it is that you have taken as your advisers, and whom you will
    be disregarding if you disobey them. 
32.3  Resort to divination as Socrates thought right, in matters in which the enquiry relates excclusively to the outcome, and where
    neither reason nor any technical knowledge provides the means that are required to discover the point in question. So accordingly, 
    when it is your duty to share a friend's danger or that of your country, you shoudn't resort to divination to ask whether you should
    share that danger. For even if the diviner should warn you that the omens from the scrifice are unfavourable, and it is clear that 
    death is protended, or mutilation of some part of your body, or exile, reason requires all the same that, even in the face of these risks,
    you should support your friend and share the danger of your country. Pay heed, then, to that greater diviner the Pythian Apollo, who
    cast out of his temple the man whol failed to come to the help of his friend when he was being murdered. 

33.1  Lay down from this momnet a certain character and pattern of behaviour for yourself, which you are to preserve both when you're 
    alone and when you're with others. 
33.2  Remain silent for the most part, or say only what is essential, and in few words. Very infrequently, however, when the occasion
    demands, do speak, but not about any of the usual topics, not about gladiators, nor about horse-races, not about atheletes,
    not about food and drink, the subjects of everyday talk; but above all, don't talk about people, either to praise or criticize them, or to compare them.
33.3  If you're able to so, then, through the manner of your own conversation bring that of your companions round to what is fit and 
    proper. But if you happen to find yourself along among strangers, keep silent.
33.4  Don't laugh much, or at many things, or without restraint.
33.5  Refuse to swear any oath at all, if that is possible, but if it isn't, refuse as far as you're able. 
33.6  Avoid parties that are hosted by outsiders and people who have no knowlege of philosophy, but if you do have occasion to 
    attend them, take great care that you don't fall back into a layman's stage of mind. For you should be clear that if your
    companionb is polluted, anyone who rubs up against him is bound to become polluted too, even if he himself happens to be clean.
33.7  In things relating to the body, take only as much as your bare need requires, with regard to food, for instance, or drink,
    clothes, housing, or household slaves; but excude everthing that is for show or luxury.
33.8  As regards sexual relations, keep youself pure, so far as you can, until you marry; but if you do indulge, confine yourself
    to what is lawful. Don't make yourself tiresome, however, to those who indulge, or be over-critical, and don't constantly call
    attention to the fact that you don't behave like them.
33.9  If someone reports to you that a certain person is speaking ill of you, don't defend youself against what has been said, but
    reply instead, ' Ah yes, he was plainly unaware of all my other faults, or else those wouldn't have been the only ones that he
    mentioned.'
33.10 There is no need on the whole to go to public shows, but if you ever have occasion to do so, show yourself as not taking sides
    of anyone other than yourself, that is to say, wish only that what actually does happen shold happen, and that only the man who 
    actually does win should win; for if you do that, you'll meet with no hindrance. But refrain entirely from shouting out, or laughing
    at anyone, or getting overexcited. And after you've left, don't talk much about what has taken place, except in so far as that
    contributes to your own improvement; for such talk would suggest that you were impressed by the spctacle.
33.11 Don't go acsually or readily to people's public readings; but if you do go, preserve your dignity and composure, taking care
    at the same time not to make yourself disgreeable. 
33.12 When you're due to meet somebody, and in particular one who is regared with hih respect, put this question to yourself: 'What
    would Socrates or Zeno have done in this situation?' And then you'll have to difficulty in making proper use of the occasion.
33.13 When you are going to meet some very powerful man, put the thought to yourself that you won't find him at home, that you'll 
    be shut out, that the door will be closed in your face, that he'll pay no heed to you. And if, in spite of all that, it is your 
    duty to go, then go, and put up with whatever comes about, and never tell yourself, 'it wasn't worth the trouble. For this is 
    the mark of a layman, of someone who can be upset by externals.
33.14 In your conversation, avoid taking at length or overmuch about your own exploits or the dangers that you've faced; for 
    pleasant though it may be for your to recall your perils, it is not as pleasant for others to listen to everthing that has 
    happened to you.
33.15 Abstain too from trying to arouse laughter, for that is behaviour that can easily slip into vulgarithy, and tends at the same
    time to cause your neighbours to view you with less respect. 
33.16 It is danerous like-wise to engage in smutty talk. So when anything like that comes up, you should if the ocassion presents 
    itself, even reproach the person who has resorted to such talk; or if that isn't possible, show by your silence at least, and 
    your blushes and frowns, that you've displeased at what is being said.

34. When you receive an impression of some pleasure, take care not to get carried away by it, as with impressions in general; 
    but rather, make it wait for you, and allow yourself some slight delay. And next, think about these two moments in time, that
    in which you'll enjoy the pleasure, and that in which you'll come to repent after having enjoyed it and will reproach yourself;
    and set against all of that how you'll rejoice if you've abstained from the pleasure, and will congratulate youself for having 
    done so. if you think, however, that a suitable occasion has come for you to engage in this task, take care that you're not 
    overcome by its allure, and by the pleaantness and attraction of it; but set against this the thought of how much better it is 
    to be conscious of having gained a victory over it.

35. When you've decided that you ought to do something and are doing it, never try to avoid being seen to do it, never try to avoid 
    being seen to do it, even if most people will probably view it with disapproval; for if it isn't right to do it, avoid doing it
    in the first place, but if it is, why be afraid of those who'll reproach you without justification?
 
36. Just as the propositions 'It is day' and 'It is night' are entirely meaningul when taken seprately, but become meaningless when
    joined into one, so likewise it may make sense with regard to your body to take the larger share at a dinner, but it makes no 
    sense at all with regard to the maintenance of proper social feeling. So when you're eating with another person, remember to 
    look not only at the value that the dishes set before you will have for your body, but also at the value of maintaining proper
    respect for your host.
 
37. If you take on a role that is beyond your power, you'll not only disgrace youself in the role, but you'll also neglect to take
    on that which you might have been capable of filling.

38. Just as, when walking round, you take care not to tread on a nail or sprain you ankle, so take care likewise to avoid harming 
    your rulling centre; and if we observe this rule in every action, we'll undertake the task in a more secure fashion.
 
39. Each person's body is the measure for his property, as the foot is for a shoe. if you abide by this principle, then, you'll maintain due measure, 
    but if you pass beyond it, you'll find youself falling, so to speak, over a cliff. It is the same in the case of a shoes: If you pass beyond 
    what the foot requires, you'll first get a gilded shoe, and then a purple one, and then an embroidered one, for as soon as you've passed 
    beyond the measure, there is no limit.

40. As soon as they reach the age of fourteen, women are called mistresses by men. And so when they see that they have no other function than to 
    become bedfellows of men, they set to work to beautify themselves, and place all their hopes in that. It is worth our while, then, to make them 
    aware that they're valued for nothing other than being modest and self-respecting.

41. It is a sign of a lack of natural aptitude to spend much time on things relating to the body, by taking a large amount of exercise, for instance, 
    and eating too much, drinking too much, and spending to9 much time emptying one's bowels and copulating. No, these things should be done in passing, 
    and you should devote undivided attention to your mind. 

42. When someone acts badly towards you, or speaks badly of you, remember that he is acting or speaking in that way because he regards that as being the 
    proper thing for him to do. Now, it isn't possible for him to act in accordance with what seems right to you, but only with what sees right to him. 
    So if he judges wrongly, he is the one who suffers the harm, since he is the one who has be deceived. For if anyone should think a true composite judgement 
    to be false, the judement itself isn't harmed, but the person who has been deceived. If you start out, then, from this way of thinking, you'll be 
    gentle with someone who abuses you, for in each case, you'll say, 'That is how it seemed to him.'

43. Everything has two handles, and it may be carried by one of these handles, but not by the other. if your brother acts wrongly towards you, don't try
    to grasp the matter by this handle, that he is wronging you (because that is the hanle by which it can't be carried), but rather by the other,
    that he is your borther, he was brought up with you, and then you'll be grasping the matter by the handle by which it can be carried. 

44. The following assertions don't form a coherent argement: 'I'm reicher than you, therefor I'm better than you' or 'I'm more eloquent than you, 
    therefore I'm better than yhou'; no, it is these that do: 'I'm richer than you, therefore my possessions are superior to yours', or 'I'm more
    eloquent than you, therefor my way of speaking is superior to yours.' But you yourself are neither your possessions nor your way of speaking.

45. Someone takes his bath in a hurry; don't say that he bathes badly, but that he does so in a hurry. Someone drinks a large amount of wine. Don't say
    that he drinks badly, but that he drinks a large amount. For until you've determined from what judgement he is proceeding, how do you know 
    whether he is acting badly? And so in that way it won't come about that you receive convincing impresssions of some things but give your assent to 
    others.

1.  Never call youself a philosopher, and don't talk among laymen for the most part about philosophical principles, but act in accordance with those
    principles. At a banquet, for example, don't talk about how one ought to eat, but eat as one ought. Remember how Socrates so completely renounced 
    all outward show that when people came to him and asked to be introduced to philosophers, he would take them along and introduce them, so readily
    did he submit to being overlooked.
2.  And accordingly, if any talk should arise among laymen about some philosophical principle, keep silent for the most part, for there is a great danger
    that you'll simply vomit up what you haven't properly digested. So when the day arrives when someone tells you that you know nothing, and you, like
    Socrates, aren't upset by that, you may be sure that you're making a start on your work as a philosopher. For sheep, too, don't vomit up their fodder
    to show the shepherds how much they've eaten, but digest their food inside them, and produce wool and milk on the outsides. And so you likewise 
    shouldn't show off your principles to laymen, but rather show them the actions that result from those principles when they've been properly digested.

47. When you've become adapted to a simple way of life in bodily matters, don't pride youself on that, and likewise, if you drink nothing but water, don't
    preclaim at every opportunity that you drink nothing but water. And if at any time you want to train yourself to endure hardship, do it for your own sake 
    and not for others; don't embrace statues, but if you ever find yourself extremely thirsty, take some colde water into your mouth and then spit it out
    again, without telling a soul. 

48
1.  The condition and character of a layman is this: that he never expects that benefit or harm will come to him from himself, but only from externals. The 
    condition and charcter of a philosopher is this: that he expects all benefit and harm to come to him from himself.
2.  The signs of one who is making progress are that he critizes no one, praises no one, blames or accuses no one, and never speaks of himself as being 
    anyone of importance, or as one who has any knowledge. And if he is praised, he laughts within at the person who is praising him, and if snyone finds
    fault with him, he makes on defence. He goes about like an invalid, taking care not to disturb any part of him that is getting better until he has achieved 
    lasting recovery.
3.  He has rid himself of every desire, and has transferred his aversion to those things alone that are contrrary to nature among the things that are within our
    own power. He is moderate in his motives whatever they may be directed towards. If he gives the impression of being foolish or ignorant, he doesn't mind.
    In a work, he keeps guard against himself, as though he were an enemy lying in ambush for himeself. 

49. When someone is filled with pride because he is able to understand and interpret the works of Chrysippus, say to yourself, 'If Chrysippus hadn't written in such an obscure 
    style, this person wouldn't have anything to pride himself on.' But what is it that I want? To understand nature and to follow it. So I look around for someone
    who can interpret it, and having heard that Chrysippus can, I go to him. But i don't understand his writings, so I look for someone who can intepret them. Up to 
    this point, there is nothing to be pround of. But when I find the interpreter, what remains for me to do is to apply his precepts; that is the only thing
    that gives any ground for pride. But if what I value is the mere act of interpretation, what else have I achieved than to have become a literary scholar instead 
    of a philosopher? The only difference is that I'm interpreting Chrysippus rather than Homer. So when someone says to me, "Read me some Chrysippus,' I blush
    rather than feeling any pride, when I'm unable to show that my actions match up to his words and are consistent with them.
 
50. Whatever rules of conduct are set for you, hold to them as if they were laws, as if it would be an act of impiety for you to transgress them; as to what 
    anyone says about you, pay no heed to it, since in the end that is not your concern. 

51
1.  How much longer will you delay before you think yourself worthy of what is best, and transgress in nothing the distinctions that reason imposes? You've 
    acquired knowledge of the philosophical principles that you ought to accept, and have accepted them. What kind of teacher, then are still waiting for, 
    that you should delay any effort to reform yourself until he appears? You're no longer a youth; you're a full-grown man. if you're now negligent and idle, 
    and are constantly making one delay after another, and setting one day and then another as the date after which you'll devote proper attention to yourself, 
    then you'll fail to appreciate that you're making no progress, but will continue to be a layman your whole life through until you die.
2.  So you should think fit from this moment to live as an adult and as one who is making progress; and let everthing that seems best to you be an inviolable law
    for you. And if you come up against anything that requires and effort, or is pleasant, or is glorious or inglorious, remember that this is the time of contest, 
    that the Olympic Games have now arrived, and that there is no possibility of further delay, and that it depends on a single day and single action whether
    progress is to be lost or secured.
3.  It was in this way that Socrates became the man he was, by attending to nothing other than reason in everythning that he had to deaL with. And even if your've not 
    yet a Socrates, you ought to live like someone who does in fact wish to be a Scocrates. 

52
1.  The first and most necessary area of study in philosophy is the one that deals with the application of principles, such as "Don't lie." The second deals with 
    demonstrations, for instance, "How is it that we oughtn't to lie?" The third confirms and analyses the other two, for instance, "How is this demonstration?"
    For what is a demonstraction, what is logical consequence, what is contradiction, what is truth, what is falsehood? 
2.  The third are of study is necessary, then, because of second, and the second because of first, but the most necessary, and that on which we should dwell, is the first.
    But we do the opposite; for we spend our time on the third area of study, and empoly all our efforts on that, while wholly neglecting the first. And so it comes 
    about that we lie, while having at hand all the argeuments that show why we oughtn't to lie.

53
1.  On every occasion we should have these arguments at hand:
    #### Guide me, O Zeus, and thou, O Destiny, 
    #### To wheresoever you have assigned me; 
    #### I'll follow unwaveringly, or if my will fails, 
    #### Base though I be, I'll follow nonetheless
2.  #### Whoever rightly yields to necessity
    #### We accord wise and learned in things divine.
3.  #### "Well, Crito, if that is what is pleasing to the gods, so be it."
4.  #### "Anytus and Meletus can kill me, but they cannot harm me."
