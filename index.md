### Book One

1.	From my grandfather Verus I learned good morals and the government of my temper.

2.	From the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly character. 

3.	From my mother, piety and beneficence, and abstinence, not only from evil deeds, 
    but even from evil thoughts; and further, simplicity in my way of living, far 
    removed from the habits of the rich.

4.  From my great-grandfather, not to have frequented public schools, and to have good
    teachers at home, and to know that on such things a man should spend liberally.

5.  From my tutor, to be neither of the green nor of the blue party at the games in 
    the Circus, not a partisan either of the Parmularius or the Scutarius at the 
    gladiators' fights; from him I learned to edure pain, and to want little, and to 			
    work with my own hands, and not to meddle with other people's affairs, and not to
    be ready to listen to slander.

6.  From Diognetus, not to get excited abou triffling things, and not to get credit 
    to what was said by miracle-workders and sorcerers about incantations and the 
    driving away of dammons and such things; and not to breed quails [ for fighting],
    nor to give myself up passionately to such things; and to allow people to have 
    their says; and to have become intimate with philosophy; and to have been a hearer, 
    first of Baccheius, then of Tandasis and Marcianus; and to have written essaies in
    my youth; and to have desired a plank bed and skin, and whatever else of the kind 
    belongs to the Grecian discipline.

7.  From Rusticus, I received the impression that my character required improvement
    and discipline; and from him I learned not to be led astray to sophistic emulation,
    nor to writing on speculative matters, nor to delivering little hortatory orations,
    nor to showing myself off as man who practices much displine, or does benevolent
    acts in order to make a display; and to abstain from rhetoric, and poetry, and fine
    writing; and not to walk about in the house in my outdoor dress, nor to do other
    things of this kind; and to write my letters with simplicity, like the letter which 
    Rusticus wrote from Sinuessa to my mother; and with respect to those who have 
    offended me by words, or done me wrong, to be easily disposed to be pacified and 
    and reconciled, as soon as they have shown a readiness to be reconciled; and to 
    read carefully, and not to be satisfied with a superficial understanding of a book; 
    nor hastily to give my assent to those who talk overmuch; and I am indebted to him 
    for being acquainted with the discourses of Epictetus, which he communicated to me 
    out of his own collection. 

8.  From Appollonius I learned freedom of will and underviating steadiness of purpose; 
    and to look to nothing else; not even for a moment, except to reason; and to be
    always the same, in sharp pains, on the occasion of the loss of a child, and in 
    long illness; and to see clearly in a living example that the same man can be both
    most resolute and yielding, and not peevish in giving his instruction; and to have 
    had before my eyes a man who clearly condidered his experience and his skill 
    in expounding philosophical principles and the samllest of his merits; and from him 
    I learned how to receive from friends what are esteemed favors, without being either
    humbled by them or letting them pass unnoticed. 

9.  From Sextus, a benevolent disposition, and the example of a family governed in a 
    fatherly manner, and the idea of living conformably to nature; and gravity without
    affectation, and to look carefully after the interestes of friends, and to tolerate
    ignorant persons, and those who form opinions without consideration: he had the 
    power of readily accomodating himself to all; so that intercourse with him was 
    more agreeable than any flattery; and at the same time he was most highly venerated 
    by those who associated with him; and he has the faculty both of the discuovering
    and ordering, in an intelligent and methodical way, the principles necessary for
    life; and he never showed anger or any other passion, but was entirely free from
    passion, and also most affectionate; and he could express approbation without 
    noisy display, and he possessed much knowledge without ostentation.

10. From Alexander the grammarian, to refrain from fault-finding, and not in a 
    reproachful way to chide those who uttered any barbarous or solecistic or 
    strange-sounding expression; but dexterously to introduce the very expression
    which ought to have been used, and in the way of answer or giving confirmation,
    or joining in an inquiry about the thing itself, not about the word, or by some 
    other fit suggestion. 
    
11. From Fronto I learned to observe what envy and duplicity and hypocrisy are in a 
    tyrant, and that generally those among us who are called Patricians are rather 
    deficient in parental affection. 

12. From Alexander the Platonic, not frequently nor without necessity to say to any 
    one, or to write in a letter, that i have no leisure; nor continually to excuse 
    the neglect of duties required by our relation to those with whom we live, by 
    alleging urgent occupations. 

13. From Catulus, not to be indifferent when a friend finds fault, even if he should
    find fault without reason, but to try to restore him to his usual disposition; 
    and to be ready to speak well of teachers, as it is reported of Domitius and 
    Athenodotus; and to love my children truly. 

14. From my brother Severus, to love my kin, and to love truth, and to love justice; 
    and through him I leared to know Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dion, Brutus; and 
    from hime I received the idea of a polity in which there is the same law for all,
    a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and 
    the idea of a kingly government which respects most of the freedom of the governed;
    I learned from him also + considtency and undeviating steadiness in my regard for
    philosophy; and a disposition to do good, and to give to others readily, and to 
    cherish good hopes; and to believe that I am loved by my friends; and in him I 
    observed no concealment of his opinions with respect to those whom he condemned, 
    and that his friends has no need to conjecture what he wished or did not wish, but 
    it was quite plain.

15. From Maximus I learned self-government, and not to be led aside by anything; and
    cheerfulness in all circumstances, as well as in illness; and a just admixture in
    the moral character of sweetness and dignity; and to do what was set before me 
    without complaining. I observed that everyone believed that he thought as he spoke,
    and that in all that he did he never had any bad intention; and he never showed 
    amazement and surprise, and was never in a hurry, and never put off doing a thing, 
    nor was perplexed nor dejected, nor did he ever laugh to disguise his vexation, nor, 
    on the other hand, was he ever passionate or suspicious. He was accustomed to do
    acts of beneficence, and was ready to forgive, and was free from all falsehood; and 
    he presented the appearance of a man who could not be diverted from right, rather than
    of a man who had been improved. I observed, too, that no man could ever think that he
    was despised by Maximus, or ever venture to think himself a better man. He had also
    the art of being humorous in an a agrreeble way. 

16. In my father I observed mildness of temper, and unchangeable resolution in the things 
    which he had determined after due deliberation; and no vain-glory in those things 
    which men call honors; and a love of labor and perseverance; and a readiness to listen 
    to those who had anything to propose for the common weal; and undeviating firmness in 
    giving to every man according to his deserts; and a knowledge derived from experience
    of the occasions for vigorous action and for remission. And I observed that he had 
    overcome all passion for boys; and he condidered himself no more than any other citizens; 
    and he released his friends from all obligation to sup with him or to attend him of 
    necessity when he went abroad, and those who had failed to accompany him, by reason of
    any urgent circumstances, always found him the same. I observed too his habit of 
    careful inquiry in all matters of deliberation, and his persistency, and that he 
    he never stopped his investigation through being satisfied with appearances which 
    first persent themselves; and that his disposition was to keep his friends, and not 
    to be soon tired of them, nor yet to be extravagant in his affection; and to be satisfied 
    on all occasions, and cheerful; and to foressee things a long way off, and to provide for
    the smallest without display; and to check immediately popular applause and all flattery; 
    and to to be ever watchful over the things which were necessary for the administration of
    the empire, and to be a good manager of the expenditure, and patiently to endure the blame
    which he got for such conduct; and he was neigher superstitious with respect to the gods, 
    nor did he court men by gifts or by trying to please them, or by flatterning the poulace; 
    but he showed sobriety in all things, and firmness, and never any mean thoughts or action, 
    nor love of novelty, And the things which conduce in any way to the commodity of life, and
    of which fortune gives and abundant supply, he used without arrogance and without excusing 
    himself; so that when he had them, he enjoyed them without affectation, and when he had 
    them not, he did not want them. No one could ever say of him that he was either a sophist 
    or a [home-bred] flippant or a pedant; but every one acknowledged him to be a man ripe,
    perfect, above flattery, able to manage his own and other men's affairs. Besides this,
    he honored those who were true philosophers, and he did not reproach those who pretended 
    to be philosophers, nor yet was he easily led by them. He was also easy in conversation, 
    and he made himself agreeable without any offensive affectation. He took a reasonable 
    care of his body's health, not as one who was greatly attached to life, nor out of regard
    to personal appearance, nor yet in a careless way, but so that through his won attention
    he very seldom stood in need of the physician's art or of medicine or external applications.
    He was most ready to give without envy to those who possessed and particular faculty, such
    as that of eloquence or knowledge of the law or of morals, or of anything else; and he gave
    them his help, that each might enjoy reputation according to he deserts; and he always acted 
    conformably to the institutions of his country, without showing any affectation of doing so.
    Further, he was not found of change nor unsteady, but he loved to stay in the same places, 
    and to employ himself about the same things; and after his paroxysms of headache came 
    immediately fresh and vigrous to his usual occupations. His screts were not many, but very 
    few and very rare, and these only about public matters; and he showed prudence and economy
    in the exhibition of the public spectacles are the construction of the public buildings,
    his donations to the people, and in such things, for he was a man who looked to what ought 
    to be done, not to the reutation which is got by a man's acts. He did not take the bath at 
    unseasonable hours; he was not fond of building houses, nor curious about what he ate, 
    nor about the texture and color of his clothes, nor about the beauty of his slaves. His 
    dress came from Lorium, his villa on the coast, and from Lanuvium generally. We know how 
    he behaved to the toll-collector at Thsculum who asked his pardon; and such was all his 
    behavior. There was in him nothing harsh, nor implacable, nor violent, nor, as one may say, 
    anything carried to the sweating point; but he examined all things serverally, as if he has
    abdundance of time, and without confusion, in an orderly way, vigoriously and consistently. 
    And that might be applied to him which is recorded of Socrates, that he was able both to 
    abstain from, and to enjoy, those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot 
    enjoy without excess. But to be strong enought both to bear the one and to be sober in the 
    other is the mark of a man who has a perfect and invincible soul, such as he showed in illness 
    of Maximus. 

17. To the gods I am indebted for having good grandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good 
    teachers, good associated, good kinsmen and friends, nearly enverthing good. Further, I
    owe it to the gods that I was not hurried into any offence against any of them, though I
    had a disposition wiich, if opportunity has offfereed, might have led me to do something 
    of this kind; but, through their favor, thre never was such a concurrence of circumstances as 
    put me to the trial. Further, I am thankful to the gods that I was not longer brought up with
    my grandfather's concubine, and that I perserved the flower of my youth, and that I did not 
    make proof of my virility before the proper season, but even deferred the time; that I was 
    subjected to a ruler and father who was able to take away all pride from me, and to bring me 
    to the knowledge that it is possible for a man to live int a palace without wanting either 
    guards or embroidered dresses, or touches and statues, and such-like show; but that it is in
    such a man's power to bring himself very near to the fashion of a private person, without 
    being for this reason either meaner in thought, or more remiss in action, with respect to 
    the things which must be done for the public interest in a manner that befits a ruler. I 
    thank the gods for giving me such a brother, who was able by his moral charcter to rouse me 
    to vigilance over myself, and who at the same time pleased me by his respect and affection;
    that my children have not been stupid nor deformed in body; that I did not make more 
    preficiency in rhetoric, poetry, and the other studies, in which I should perhaps have been 
    completely engaged, if I had seen that I was making progress in them; that I made haste to 
    place those who brought me up in the station of honor, which they seemed to desire, without
    putting them off with hope of my doing it some other time after, because they were then still
    young; the I new Apollonius, Rusticus, Maximus, that I received clear and frequent impressions 
    about living according to nature, and what kind of a life that is, so that, so far as
    depended on the gods, and their gifts, and hlep, and inspirations, nothing hindered me from 
    forthwith living according to nature, thought I still fall short of it throught my own fault, 
    and through my won fault, and through not observing the admonitions of the gods, and, I may
    almost say, their direct instructions; that my body has held out so long in such a kind of 
    life ; that I never touched either Bendicta or Thoedotus, and that, after having fallen into 
    matory passions, I was cured, and, though I was often out of humor with Rusticus, I never did 
    anything of which I had occasion to repent; that, though it was my mother's fate to die young, 
    she spent the last years of her life with me; that, whenever I wished to help any man in his 
    need, or on any other occasion, I was never told that I had not the means of doing it; and 
    that to myself the same necessity never happended, to received anything from another; that I 
    have such a wife, so obedient, and so affectionate, and so simple; that had abundance of 
    good masters for my children; and that remedies have been shown to me by dreams, both others, 
    and against bloodspitting and giddiness...; and that, when I had an inclination to philosophy, 
    i didn't not fall into the hands of any sophist, and that I did not waste my time on writers 
    [of histoories], or in the resolution of syllyogisms, or occupy myself bout the investigation 
    of apperaances in the heaverns; for all these things require the help of gods and foutune.

### Book Two

1.  Begin the moring by saying to yourself, I shall meet witht he busybody, the ungrateful, arrogant,
    deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what 
    is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad 
    that is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not [only] of the same 
    blood or seed, but that it participates in [the same] intelligence and [the same] portion of the 
    divinity, I can neigher be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can 
    I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him, for we are made for co-operation, like feet, like hands,
    like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth. To act aginst one another, then, is 
    contrary to nature; and it is acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away. 

    每天清晨对你自己说： 我将要遇到好管闲事的人， 忘恩负义的人， 狂妄无礼的人， 欺骗的人， 嫉妒的人， 孤傲的人。 他们
    所以如此, 乃是因为不能分辨善与恶。 但是我， 只因已了悟那美丽的“善“的性质， 那丑陋的”恶“的性质， 那和我很接近的行
    恶者本身的性质 -- 他不仅与我在血统上同一来源， 而且具有同样的理性与神圣的本质， 所以我既不会受他们任何一个的伤害（因为
    没人能把我拖累到堕落里去）， 亦不会对我的同胞发怒而恨他； 我们生来是为合作的， 如双足，两手， 上下眼皮， 上下排的
    牙齿。所以彼此冲突乃是违反自然的， 表示反感和厌恶便是冲突。

2.  Whatever this that I am, it is a little flesh and breath, and the ruling part. Throw away the books; 
    no longer distract themselves: it is not allowd; but as if thou wast now dying, despise the flesh; 
    it is blood and nones and a network, a contexture of nerves, veins, and arteries. See the breath 
    also, what kind of a thing it is; air, and not always the same, but every moment sent out and again
    sucked in. the thrid, then, is the ruling part; condider thus: Thou art and old man; no longer let 
    this be a slave, no longer be pulled by the strings like a puppet to unsocial movements, no longer
    be either dissatisfied with the present lot, or shrink from the future.

    我之所以为我， 不过是一堆肉， 一口气和一股控制一切的理性。 丢开你的书本！ 不要再被书本所困惑， 那是不可以的。 要像
    一个垂死的人一般， 轻视那肉体 -- 那不过是一汪子血， 几根骨头， 神经和血管组成的网架。 再看看那一口气， 究竟是什么
    东西 -- 空气而已， 还不是国定的一口气， 没分钟都要呼出去， 吸进来， 剩下的是理性； 要这样想， 你是个老年人了， 不
    要再做奴隶， 不要再做被各种私欲所牵挂的傀儡， 不要再令他怨恨现世的命运， 并且恐惧未来的命运。
 
3.  All that is from the gods is full of providence. That which is from fortune is not separated from the 
    nature of without an interweaving and involution with the things which are ordered by providence. From 
    thence all things flow; and there is besides necessity, and that which is for the advantage of the whole
    universe, of which thou art a part. But that is good for every part of nature which the nature of the
    whole brings, and what serves to maintain this nature. Not the universe is preserved, as by the changes 
    of the elements so by the changes of things compounded of the elements. Let these principles be enough
    for thee; let them always be fixed opinions. But cast away the thirst after books, that thou mayest not
    die murmuring, but cheerfully, truely, and from thy heart thankful to the gods. 

    神的安排都充满了神意， 就是命运的播弄也不是脱离自然的， 也不能脱离由神意支配着的安排与编插。 一切都由神意而来； 不过“必然性” 以及
    “整个宇宙的福利” （而你只是其中一小部分）， 也是有其作用的。 整个的自然之所产生的， 整个的自然之所进行维系的，对于自然之
    各个部分亦必有利。但是宇宙之保全则有赖于变化， 不仅是元素变化， 且扩及与由元素复合而成的事物之变化。这样的想法对你是很充分足够
    的了， 如果你引为原则来看待。 放弃对书本所报的渴望吧， 以便死时了无遗憾， 而能从容不迫从心底里感谢天神。

4.  Remember how long thou hast been putting off these things, and how often thou hast received and opportunity 
    from the gods, and yet doesn't use it. Thou must now at last perceive of what universe thou art a part, 
    and of what administrator of the universe thy existence is an efflux, and that a limit of time is fixed for
    thee, which if thou dost not use for clearning away the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go,
    and it will never return.
 
5.  Every moment think steadily as a Roman and man to do what thou hast in hand with perfect and simple dignity, 
    and feeling of affection, and freedom, and justice, and to give thyself relief from all other thoughts. And
    thou wilt give thyself relief if thou doest every act of thy lefe as it were the last, laying aside all
    carelessness an passionate aversion from the commmands of reason, and all hypocisy, and self-love, and 
    discontent with the portion which has been given to thee. Thou seest how few the things are, the which if a 
    man lays hold of, he is able to live a life which flows in quiet, and is like the existence of the gods; 
    for the gods on their part will require nothing more from him who observes these things. 

6.  Do wrong to yourself, my soul; but thou wilt no longer have the opportunity of honoring thyself. Every man's 
    life is ufficient. But thine is nearly finished, though thy soul reverences not itself, but places the felicity
    in the souls of others. 

7.  Do the things external which fall upon thee distract thee? Give thyself time learn something new and good, and
    cease to be whirled around. But then thou must also avoid being carried about the other way; for thouse too
    are triflers who have wearied themselves in life by their activity, and yet have no object to which to direct
    every movment, and, in a word, all their thoughts. 

8.  Through not observing what is in the mind of another a man has seldom been seen to be unhappy; but those who do 
    not observe the movements of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy.
